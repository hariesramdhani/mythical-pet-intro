            <ul>
                <li>Invite the bot by scanning the QR code using your LINE APP</li>
                <li>Type ‘Hello &lt;your_pet_name&gt;’</li>
                <li>Type ‘qr’, the menu will pop up and you’re ready to play</li>

            <p>Even with the complex features, the chatbot is made as simple as possible so it will easily be digested by the user. The usage of carousels, flex boxes and the digital images that were drawn are optimized (not too much and not too less). This will allow the bot to work faster and keep the data cost lower (considering that the user wont always be in a wi-fi-present environment). The backend code for the chatbot is also optimized to make the bot processes as fast as possible.</p>
